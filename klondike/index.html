    <h1>Klondike</h1>

    <p>
    Try to move all cards to the foundations (the 4 empty places at top right).
    </p>

    <!-- TODO: write more rules -->

    <div id="game" class="game-area"></div>

    <button id="new-game-button" class="new-game-button">New Game</button>

    <p>
    You can move a card to any of the foundations by clicking the card with the
    wheel of the mouse (yes, you can click with that wheel; just press it down
    instead of rolling it). If you wheel-click an area of the game that is not
    a card, then <strong>any</strong> card in the game that can be moved to a
    foundation will be moved there.
